## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r tBoot}
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrapping_(statistics)#Bootstrap_hypothesis_testing
tStat = function(x,y) {
  (mean(x)-mean(y)) / sqrt( var(x)/length(x) + var(y)/length(y)  )
}

tBoot = function(x,y, B=1000) {
  n = length(x)
  m = length(y)
  xmean = mean(x)
  ymean = mean(y)
  t = tStat(x,y)
  
  zmean = mean(c(x,y))
  xprime = x - xmean + zmean
  yprime = y - ymean + zmean
  
  dist = replicate(B,
                    {
                      x_star = sample(xprime, length(xprime), replace=T)
                      y_star = sample(yprime, length(yprime), replace=T)
                      return(tStat(x_star,y_star))
                    })
  return(list(t=t,dist=dist,p.greater=sum(dist >= t)/B))
}

tBootStat=tBoot(rnorm(15,1),rnorm(15,0))
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
