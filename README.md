## Welcome to stats workshop 2021!
Every summer, the [Osborne-Nishimura lab](https://onishlab.colostate.edu/) does a summer workshop series, and it has grown every year! This summer we're focusing on different topics related to regression, linear or otherwise.

This repository will provide the resources, code and presentation material necessary to follow along with each presenter.
