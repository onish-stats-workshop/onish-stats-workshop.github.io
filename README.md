## Welcome to stats workshop 2021!
Every summer, the [Osborne-Nishimura lab](https://onishlab.colostate.edu/) does a summer workshop series, and it has grown every year! This summer we're focusing on different topics related to regression, linear or otherwise.

Linear regression is a popular method for finding the relationship between quantitative measurements. There are many relevant aspects that go beyond "fitting Y to X", taking R-squared, and finding a p-value.  This workshop will highlight some aspects of regression, (not just the linear variety), that we may not commonly use in our research, or never learned in the first place, or may be using incorrectly.

## Call for presenters
We're looking for presenters! 

### Format

Enterprising folks are encouraged to build their presentation into an RMarkdown document so that the audience can follow along. However, straight PowerPoint presentations are also welcome.
